title = advanced hard drive format

Newer hard drives (circa 2012) are building drives that use a 4KB sector size instead of the conventional 512B. This requires a specific type of formatting to make sure the alignment of the drive is correct, allowing the OS to take full advantage of the performance of the drive. If the drives partition table is not aligned to a single sector that is a multiple of 512, but at least 2x512B, then it will potentially allow gaps between each sector. Ubuntu will throw an error in the disk utilty saying the "Warning: The partition table is misaligned by n number of bytes", and the drive will not perform fully.

For this article I am using a Seagate 2TB ATA ST2000DM001-9YN164 which I am formatting in a single partition as ext4.

I reference this article heavily via linuxconfig.org: [Linux ED EARS Advanced Hard Drive Format](http://linuxconfig.org/linux-wd-ears-advanced-format)

By default, linux partitioned my drive with the start of each partition on sector 63, which lead to warnings from Ubuntu because they are not aligned to 4K sector from the beginning of the track.

The following assumes your disk is labled as <code>sda</code>.
<pre class="prettyprint"># fdisk -u /dev/sda

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 121601.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
