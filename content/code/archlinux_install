Documentation of the process of installing [archlinux](http://www.archlinux.org/) and Windows 7 in a dual-boot configuration. 

## System Specs

- AMD X2 dual-core processor, running at 2.8 ghz, circa 2002
- ASUS ATX motherboard
- 2 gigs of ram
- 100gb drive
- nvidia gtx 550 ti graphics card
- linksys wmp54g wireless pci network card
- 550w power supply



## Installing Windows
Windows was installed from a USB stick using Microsoft's [Windows 7 USB/DVD tool](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool). It's required to create this key from a Windows 7 system. Boot with the USB drive, then install Windows on the drive in a single partition. Windows also creates a System Reserved partition for itself. Once installed, via Start Menu > Administrative Tools > Computer Management > Disk Manamagent, select 'Shrink Partition' on the main Windows parition to create another partition for Arch. The default value for the shrink is 50%, so for my setup the value for the new disk size was ~50GB, which was ideal. 

Note about this install. I have an old Linksys (Cysco) WMP54G Wireless PCI Card. Drivers from Linksys/Cysco's website didn't work, but following this [blog post](http://www.phishthis.com/2009/01/16/how-to-install-wmp54g-drivers-on-windows-7-beta-64-bit-or-vista-64-bit/), the generic RALink drivers worked great.

## Installing Archlinux

I downloading the Core Image via [torrent](http://www.archlinux.org/iso/2011.08.19/archlinux-2011.08.19-core-dual.iso.torrent) from [http://www.archlinux.org/download/](http://www.archlinux.org/download/).
This ISO includes all core packages so the system doesn't need to be online to install.

Once downloaded, I followed the [notes](http://quilime.com/code/bootable_iso/) on how to create a bootable ISO onto another USB drive with yet another machine. There are also numerous free tools available to make a bootable ISO on Windows. After booting into Arch with the USB stick, boot into Arch, and type:

<pre>/arch/setup</pre>

The [installation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Official_Arch_Linux_Install_Guide) article on the archwiki is an excellent resource.



## Disk Partitions

It's pretty straight forward until the drive partitions. My 100GB drive can only support 4 logical partitions, so the rest have to be Logical. Note: The numbers are out of order, because I used Logical partitions for everything except for the Windows partitions and /home. Logical partitions end up being counted last in the partition table, but I made my /home folder LAST so I could use the up the remaining space on the drive. You'll also need to set the	 /boot partition's 'bootable' flag to `true`.

<pre>
&bull; sda1  
	Windows 7 System Reserved
&bull; sda2  
	Windows 7  
&bull; sda5  
	/boot - 100MB is enough
&bull; sda6
	/ - about 25GB is appropriate
&bull; sda7
	swap - between 1024MB and 4096MB
&bull; sda4
	/home - use rest of hard drive
</pre>

Some of these, namely **boot**, **swap**, and **home**, are *optional*.



## Select Packages

At minimum, you'll need the core packages that are already selected. I also included certain key packages such as OpenSSH. Basically, include any packages you need for internet connectivity, as everything else will be updated from the net.



## Configure System

Configure system does multiple things, including setting the root password, network settings, and some other configuration tools. Here's a reference of where Arch installs all the base config files for the system.

<pre class="prettyprint">
/etc/rc.conf					system config
/etc/fstab						filesystem mountpoints
/etc/mkinitcpio.conf			initramfs config
/etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf	kernel modules
/etc/resolv.conf				dns servers
/etc/hosts						network hosts
/etc/locale.get 				glibc locals
/etc/pacman.conf				pacman.confg
/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist		pacman mirror list
</pre>

You should edit any of these files that are specific to your system. At minimum I enabled my network card in `rc.conf`.

You'll also need to enable at least one mirror in pacman.d/mirrorlist if you plan to update the system or download new packages.



## Bootloader

Install Bootloader will install and help you configure the bootloader you selected in the Select Packages stage (GRUB, in my case). After double-checking your bootloader configuration, you'll be prompted for a disk to install the loader to. You should install GRUB to the MBR of the installation disk, in this case `sda1`.



## Finalizing Installation

Once installed, exit the installer, remove the USB, type `reboot` in the command line, and the system will reboot. You'll boot into a login screen, which you can login with via root.

You can create [new users](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Users_and_Groups) interactively with `adduser`.

You can install/update packages with Arch's package manager, [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman).

Before installing any packages, sync the package list with:

<pre class="prettyprint">pacman --sync --refresh</pre>

To add a new package (vim, in this case), type:

<pre class="prettyprint">pacman -S vim</pre>


next: getting node and a webserver installed.
