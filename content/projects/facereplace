By [Gabriel Dunne](https://github.com/quilime) and [Toby Shachman](https://github.com/electronicwhisper). 

Created and shown over 36 hours during [ArtHackDay "Lethal Software"](http://arthackday.net/gaffta/) 
at [GAFFTA](http://gaffta.org), December 15, 2012.

Physical installation built with a pre-existing art frame prototype. Viewers experience the work as a large
portrait mirror, and they see a face superimposed onto their own in real time. Viewers can take a snapshot 
of their own face which immediately becomes superimposed onto their own. As people view the mirror, subsequent 
people have their faces replaced by the previous viewers faces.

A physical knob enables viewers to explore faces people have saved.

Built with [OpenFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks) 
and [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker) and based on examples 
in [FaceSubstitution](https://github.com/arturoc/FaceSubstitution).
