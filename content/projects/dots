Human generated tones are rendered with lines. The software manipulates these tones via random visual noise, making both audio and visual more chaotic of time. Tones start rigid and rhythmic, slowly degenerating into an organic, complex and chaotic system of overlapping frequencies and polyrhythms.



<!--
"Dots" is an interaction between human and computational order and chaos. 
Notes are generated in an circular ordered, repetitive pattern. Connection lines 
represent human-played audio tones, line length representing pitch. 
While notes are played by the human musician, the notes wander away from their original 
places, warping and distorting the connecting lines, resulting in a more chaotic 
and unusual soundscape as time passes.
