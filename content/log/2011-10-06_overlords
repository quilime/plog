> The case of India is particularly instructive. The main difference between us and the British in India was that they had no real motives for going there&mdash;no conscious objectives, that is, except such trivial and temporary ones as trade or hostility to other European powers. They found themselves possessors of an empire before they knew what to do with it, and were never really happy until they had got rid of it again.
