> Together the nine triangles are interlaced in such a way as to form 43 smaller triangles in a web symbolic of the entire cosmos or a womb symbolic of creation. Together they express Advaita or non-duality. This is surrounded by a lotus of eight petals, a lotus of sixteen petals, and an earth square resembling a temple with four doors.[1]

> The Shri Chakra is also known as the nava chakra because it can also be seen as having nine levels. Each level corresponds to a mudra, a yogini, and a specific form of the deity Tripura Sundari along with her mantra. These levels starting from the outside or bottom layer are:[1]

1. Trailokya Mohana or Bhupara, a square of three lines with four portals
2. Sarvasa Paripuraka, a sixteen-petal lotus
3. Sarva Sankshobahana, an eight-petal lotus
4. Sarva Saubhagyadayaka, composed of fourteen small triangles
